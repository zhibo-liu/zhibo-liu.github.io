## PUBLICATIONS

**Zhibo Liu, Feng Gao, Yizhou Wang. A Generative Adversarial Network for AI-Aided Chair Design**. *IEEE Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (IEEE MIPR)**, **2019*   [project page](http://zhibo-liu.com/chair)                   

- Presented a deep neural network designed to enhance the human process of chair design, incorporating an image synthesis module and a super-resolution module. This work represents the first instance of a physical chair created with deep neural network assistance, effectively bridging the gap between AI and design.

**Juncheng Liu, Zhibo Liu. Analysis of Power Quality Evaluation Method Stipulated by IEC 62749: Assessment of power quality-characteristics of electricity supplied by pubic networks.** *High Power Converter Technology, 2016*           

- Analyzed various methods for evaluating power quality (PQ) and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), concluding that under identical limitation values, PQ evaluation methods are stricter than those for EMC.

**Juncheng Liu, Zhibo Liu. Analysis for Active Power Filter (APF) Application Bottlenecks.** *Information Technology - Power Quality, 2012*                                                    

- Investigated the bottlenecks in Active Power Filter (APF) applications and its response characteristics to dynamic harmonics. Conducted simulations to assess APF response to changes in dynamic harmonic sources.
