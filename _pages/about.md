Hello, I'm 刘之博 (Zhi-Bo Liu), a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Xi'an Jiaotong University, specializing in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and a Master's degree in Statistics from George Washington University.
My research interests lie at the dynamic intersection of Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on their applications in Medical AI, Green AI, and Material

Bridging the Gap Between AI and Design.
======
In this work, we explore the intersection of AI and design by presenting a method that enhances human creativity in chair design. Our approach leverages the power of AI to generate numerous chair design candidates, thereby inspiring and facilitating the human designer's process. By creating sketches and 3D models based on the generated designs, we aim to bridge the gap between AI-driven innovation and human artistic expression.

HistoRL.
======
The goal of this ongoing project is to replicate how doctors examine and interpret Whole Slide Images (WSIs). To achieve this, we have developed a custom gym environment and employed deep reinforcement learning techniques to train a policy that can effectively analyze WSIs. By mimicking the cognitive processes of doctors, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of pathological analysis.
